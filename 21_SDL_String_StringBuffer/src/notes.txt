Java implements strings as objects of type String.  
It has methods to compare two strings, search for a substring, concatenate two strings, and change the case of letters within a string. 
Also, String objects can be constructed in number of ways, making it easy to obtain a string when 
needed. 

Once a String object has been created, the character sequence that make up the string cannot be replaced, deleted or extended. Hence, String objects are immutable. 
For those cases in which a modifiable string is desired, there is a companion class to String called StringBuffer, whose objects contain strings that can be modified after they are created. 

Both the String and StringBuffer classes are defined in java.lang. 
Thus, they are available to all programs automatically.   

String Construcrtors
String(char chars[])   
String(char chars[ ], int startIndex, int numChars)  
String(String strObj)  
String(byte asciiChars[ ])  
String(byte asciiChars[ ], int startIndex, int numChars) 

String methods
charAt(int index) //Returns the char value at the specified index.
codePointAt(int index) //Returns the character (Unicode code point) at the specified index.
compareTo(String anotherString) //Compares two strings lexicographically.
	If the result is 0, the strings are equal.
	If the result is negative, the invoking string comes before anotherString alphabetically.
	If the result is positive, the invoking string comes after anotherString alphabetically.
compareToIgnoreCase(String str) // Compares two strings lexicographically, ignoring case differences.
concat(String str) // Concatenates the specified string to the end of this string
contains(CharSequence s) //Returns true if and only if this string contains the specified sequence of char values.
endsWith(String suffix) //Tests if this string ends with the specified suffix.
equals(Object anObject) //Compares this string to the specified object.
equalsIgnoreCase(String anotherString) //Compares this String to another String, ignoring case considerations.
format(Locale l, String format, Object... args) //Returns a formatted string using the specified locale, format string, and arguments.
getBytes() // Encodes this String into a sequence of bytes using the platform's default charset, storing the result into a new byte array.
getChars(int srcBegin, int srcEnd, char[] dst, int dstBegin) //Copies characters from this string into the destination character array.
indexOf(int ch) // Returns the index within this string of the first occurrence of the specified character.
isEmpty() //Returns true if, and only if, length() is 0.
lastIndexOf(int ch) // Returns the index within this string of the last occurrence of the specified character.


When you create a String object, you are creating a string that cannot be changed. 
Once a String object has been created, you cannot change the characters that comprise that string. 
You can still perform all types of string operations.
Each time you need an altered version of an existing string, a new String object is created that contains the modifications. 
The original string is left unchanged. 
When  a modifiable string is desired, Java provides two options: StringBuffer and StringBuilder. 
Both hold strings that can be modified after they are created.
String, StringBuffer, and StringBuilder classes are defined in java.lang.
All are declared final, which means that none of these classes may be subclassed.
All three implement the CharSequence interface.

String Length
The length of a string is the number of characters that it contains. 
To obtain this value, call the length( ) method.
public class StringLengthDemo {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		char[] chars = { 'a', 'b', 'c' };
		String s = new String(chars);
		System.out.println(s.length());
		s = new String("MIT Manipal");
		System.out.println(s.length());
	}
}

equals( ) Versus ==
equals( ) method compares the characters inside a String object. 
The == operator compares two object references to see whether they refer to the same instance. 
class EqualsNotEqualTo {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		String s1 = "Hello";
		String s2 = new String(s1);
		System.out.println(s1 + " equals " + s2 + " -> " +s1.equals(s2));
		System.out.println(s1 + " == " + s2 + " -> " + (s1 == s2));
	}
}

StringBuffer
StringBuffer supports a modifiable string. 
StringBuffer represents growable and writable character sequences. 
StringBuffer may have characters and substrings inserted in the middle or appended to the end. 
StringBuffer will automatically grow to make room for such additions and often has more characters preallocated than are actually needed, to allow room for growth.

StringBuffer Constructors
StringBuffer( )
StringBuffer(int size)
StringBuffer(String str)
StringBuffer(CharSequence chars)

StringBuffer Methods:

length( ) and capacity( )
The current length of a StringBuffer can be found via the length( ) method. 
Total allocated capacity can be found through the capacity( ) method. 
They have the following general forms:
int length( )
int capacity( )

append( )
Concatenates the string representation of any other type of data to the end of the invoking StringBuffer object. 
It has several overloaded versions. Here are a few of its forms:
StringBuffer append(String str)
StringBuffer append(int num)
StringBuffer append(Object obj)

First, the string representation of each parameter is obtained. 
Then, the result is appended to the current StringBuffer object. 
The buffer itself is returned by each version of append( ).
This allows subsequent calls to be chained together, as shown in the following example:

class AppendDemo {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer(40);
		int a = 42;
		String s = sb.append("a = ").append(a).append("!").toString();
		System.out.println(s);
	}
}

insert( )
Inserts one string into another. 
It is overloaded to accept values of all the primitive types, plus Strings, Objects, and CharSequences. 
Like append( ), it obtains the string representation of the value it is called with. 
This string is then inserted into the invoking StringBuffer object. These are a few of its forms:
StringBuffer insert(int index, String str)
StringBuffer insert(int index, char ch)
StringBuffer insert(int index, Object obj)
class InsertDemo {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer("I Java!");
		sb.insert(2, "like ");
		System.out.println(sb);
	}
}

Few more methods, you can refer to the Textbook
reverse( )
delete( ) and deleteCharAt( )
replace( )
substring( )


StringBuilder
StringBuilder is similar to StringBuffer except for one important difference: it is not synchronized, which means that it is not thread-safe. 
The advantage of StringBuilder is faster performance. 
However, in cases in which a mutable string will be accessed by multiple threads, and no external synchronization is employed, you must use StringBuffer rather than StringBuilder.
